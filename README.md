# python_tutorials_CoreySchafer

Python tutorial files I create as I follow along with Corey Schafer YT videos

NOTE: These are not tutorials in and of themselves, this is just me writing some of the same or similar code as Corey is doing, tweaking it, commenting out code as I work further into the tutorial. You can't really learn Python simply by watching someone else do it :-D
